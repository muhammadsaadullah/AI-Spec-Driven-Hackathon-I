# Course Modules

This course is structured around four main modules that build upon each other to provide a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Focus: Middleware for robot control.

- [ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services](/docs/modules/ros2/nodes-topics-services)
- [Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy](/docs/modules/ros2)
- [Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids](/docs/modules/ros2/urdf-humanoids)
- [ROS 2 Fundamentals](/docs/modules/ros2/fundamentals)

## Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Focus: Physics simulation and environment building.

- [Gazebo simulation environment setup](/docs/modules/gazebo-unity/simulation-setup)
- [Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo](/docs/modules/gazebo-unity/physics-collision)
- [High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity](/docs/modules/gazebo-unity)
- [Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs](/docs/modules/gazebo-unity/sensors-simulation)

## Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Focus: Advanced perception and training.

- [NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation](/docs/modules/nvidia-isaac/isaac-sim)
- [Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation](/docs/modules/nvidia-isaac/vsalm-navigation)
- [Nav2: Path planning for bipedal humanoid movement](/docs/modules/nvidia-isaac/nav2-path-planning)

## Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Focus: The convergence of LLMs and Robotics.

- [Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands](/docs/modules/vla/voice-to-action)
- [Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language into ROS 2 actions](/docs/modules/vla/cognitive-planning)
- [Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid](/docs/modules/vla/capstone-project)

## Learning Path

Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive learning path from fundamental concepts to advanced applications. You can navigate through the modules sequentially or jump to specific topics based on your interests and needs.
