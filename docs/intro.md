# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This comprehensive curriculum bridges the gap between digital AI and physical robots, teaching you how to apply AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

## Course Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You will learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
- Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics

## Course Structure

The course is organized into four main modules:

1. **[The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/modules/ros2)** - Middleware for robot control
2. **[The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/modules/gazebo-unity)** - Physics simulation and environment building
3. **[The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](/docs/modules/nvidia-isaac)** - Advanced perception and training
4. **[Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/docs/modules/vla)** - Convergence of LLMs and Robotics

## Weekly Breakdown

The course follows a 13-week schedule with progressive learning from foundational concepts to advanced applications:

- **Weeks 1-2**: [Introduction to Physical AI](/docs/weekly-breakdown/weeks-1-2-intro-physical-ai)
- **Weeks 3-5**: [ROS 2 Fundamentals](/docs/weekly-breakdown/weeks-3-5-ros2-fundamentals)
